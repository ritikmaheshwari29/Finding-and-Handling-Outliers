# Finding-and-Handling-Outliers

## There are 2 types of Outliers:
a) Univariate: outliers in a single variable.--------------------------------------------------------(Boxplot)

b) Bivariate: are points which lie far from the expected values when 2 variables are plotted against each other. ------------------------------------------(Scatterplot)

## Winsorization: 
- It is a way to minimize the influence of outliers in data by either deleting the extreme observations of the data or by changing the value so that it is close to other values in the set.
- Concept of Winsorization is based on Concept of Normal Distribution.


## Handling the Outliers...
1) Deleting
2) Capping: refers to replacing the outliers to a near value 
 
 ### Note: Other than Deleting and Capping , there are 2 more ways of handling the outliers.
 - Imputing: if an outlier seems to be due to some mistake and we recognize the mistake.
 - Binning: process of transforming numerical variables into categorical type.
